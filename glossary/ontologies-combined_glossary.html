                        It is typically used in framework agreements where the suppliers have already been
                        pre-selected, and the mini competition is used to determine which supplier is best
                        suited for a particular project or contract.
                        It is also used in a Dynamic Purchasing System where the suppliers come from a list
                        of Candidates.</td>

                        Socially Responsible Public Procurement (SRPP) -
                        Â‘SRPPÂ’ means Procurement Operations that take into account one or more of the following
                        social considerations: employment opportunities, decent work, compliance with social
                        and labour rights, social inclusion (including persons with disabilities), equal opportunities,
                        accessibility design for all, taking account of sustainability criteria, including
                        ethical trade issues and wider voluntary compliance with corporate social responsibility
                        (CSR), while observing the principles enshrined in the Treaty for the European Union

                        At the present time Procurement Procedures are not fully electronic. At a later date,
                        information on the Tenders received could be inferred by the data in the eProcurement
                        System.
                        Therefore this class is temporal and should cease to exist in fully electronic Procurement.
                        The need for its presence responds also to the alignment with the Regulation (EU)
                        2019/1780 (eForms).
                        
                        Attention will have to be paid in the future to possible inconsistencies derived from
                        data placed in other classes and data held in the Statistical Information class; e.g.
                        the TenderEvaluation class (see eEvaluation diagram) has the attribute admissibileTender
                        indicator, which in case of being false, may enter in contradiction with the highest
                        or lowest Tender value for that very same inadmissible Tender.

                        For some Procedures, the Subcontractor signs as well the Contract between the Buyer
                        and the Contractor.
                        
                        At tendering time, entities relied upon by the Economic Operators can be Subcontractors
